# Functions Exercise 3

Based on the prior exercise where you parsed the serial number from show_version, [here](../../day1/loops/exercise3.md)...

1. Create two functions:
    a. Function1 opens the file and returns all of the data in the file as a text string. This function should take one argument (the filename).
    b. Function2 parses the show_version output and returns the serial number
