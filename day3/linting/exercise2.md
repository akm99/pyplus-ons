# Linting Exercise 2

1. Copy the original "exercise1.py" file to a new file named "exercise2.py". Run Black against this file in "diff" mode i.e. with the "--diff" flag to show the changes that Black *would* make to this file.
2. Run Black against this "exercise2.py" file. Now run pycodestyle against this file. Note, Black should have automatically fixed all of the pycodestyle issues. Pylint is a bit more pedantic so Pylint would still flag some issues on this file.
