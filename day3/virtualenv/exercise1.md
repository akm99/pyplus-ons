# Virtual Environments Exercise 1

1. Make a new directory "MY_VENV" in your home directory.
2. Create a virtual environment "VENV" in this new directory.
3. Deactivate the current virtual environment (note that on login to the host you are automatically activating a virtual envrinment, so you need to `deactivate` that one!).
4. Activate the new virtual environment.
5. Execute the `pip list` command to make sure you have no (or very few) packages installed.
6. Use `pip` to install netmiko.
8. View `pip list` again to see what is now installed.
